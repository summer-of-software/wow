This folder contains the original WOW server in C++. This code was first hacked together from
the RTWho server (see the RTWho project in this repository). It was used during WOW's first
stages of development, but is currently not up to date. It can be used, however, as a seed for
a more complete and modern version of a WOW server in C++.

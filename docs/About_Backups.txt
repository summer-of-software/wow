WOW backups are handled every night by the main server's cronjob.

Please set the location of the backup script to:
/home/backup/conf/backup

Set the location of the LOG variable (in the backup script) to:
/home/backup/logs/log.txt

Any events (including successful transfers) are placed in the log file.

			Window on the World, or WOW for short, is a look-up tool for staff members.
			To search for specific staff members, we use the search bar:<br />
			<img src="img/tutorial/searchbar.png" alt="The search bar is a text field with a button underneath it." />
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's try a practice search.  First, click on the search bar where it says, "Enter WOW query here..."<br />
			Clicking will automatically remove that message.  Now press the <span id="bold">a</span> key so that it appears like this:<br />
			<img src="img/tutorial/akey.png" alt="Make sure the search bar only contains the letter 'a'." />
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the key is inserted, execute a search by pressing the <span id="bold">enter</span> (or <span id="bold">return</span>) key.
			You can also click on the Search button below the text field.
			It should return a list of results that look something like this:<br />
			<img src="img/tutorial/akeyresults.png" alt="A long list of results formatted into a table." />
		</p>
		<p>
			What this did was send a search to the database for anyone with the letter <span id="bold">a</span> in their last name.<br />
			The search works phone book-style, in that a last name is placed before the first name.<br />
			So what if you want to search <span id="emphasis">only</span> for a first name?
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's say we want to find everyone in the database that has the word <span id="bold">hill</span> in their <span id="bold">first name</span>.
			Click inside of the search bar.  Press backspace once to remove the <span id="bold">a</span> key.  The search bar should now be empty.<br />
			First, press the <span id="bold">space bar</span> key.
			Next, type the word <span id="bold">hill</span> into the search bar.  
			Once you've done this, perform a search by pressing <span id="bold">enter</span>/<span id="bold">return</span> or by clicking on the Search button.
			The result will look similar to this:<br />
			<img src="img/tutorial/hillsearch.png" alt="Results containing the word 'hill' in the first name." />
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you know how to find information with a last name or a first name.
			It's just as simple to search for a first name <span id="emphasis">and</span> a last name:
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's say we want to find someone named <span id="bold">Chris Beattie</span>.  
			First, <span id="bold">double-click</span> on the search bar.  This will highlight all of the text from the previous search.
			Once highlighted, press the <span id="bold">backspace</span> key to remove everything from the search bar.
			Type into the text field, <span id="bold">Beattie Chris</span>.  The result will look like this:<br />
			<img src="img/tutorial/chrissearch.png" alt="A couple of entries -- or none at all." />
		</p>
		<p>
			You don't have to enter entire names to find the person you're looking for.  
			Try experimenting with different combinations of letters or names.
		</p>
		<p> 
		    <span id = "bold">@Searches</span> are useful if you want to find everyone associated with a certain thing.  There are seven things that people can 
			be associated with and they are: <span id = "emphasis">phone, email, department, campus, role, fax and office</span>.  
			The quickest and easiest way of doing an @Search is to use one of the buttons under <span id="bold">Search+</span>. Clicking Fax Numbers will
			give you all the fax numbers.  Clicking either Phone Number or Office Search will place either @phone or @office in the search bar. All that you
			need to do is supply all or part of the phone number or office you are looking for.  For example, if you want to see all the results for offices that start
			with "gr", <span id = "bold">click</span> Office Search and <span id="bold">add</span> a <span id="emphasis">space</span> then gr after @office in the search bar.  
			<br /><img src = "img/tutorial/atSearch1.png" alt="OR @phone, @email, @department, @campus, @role, @fax and @office">
			<br /><br />Then <span id="bold">click</span> search.
			This will produce results for <span id="emphasis">all</span> offices starting with "gr" (<span id = "emphasis">NOTE: Not all columns are shown</span>). <br/><img src = "img/tutorial/atSearch1_r.png" alt="@search results for gr"> <br />
			<br />If you want to do a department search <span id = "bold">click</span> Department Search under <span id="bold">Search+</span>.  This will open up a new window
			with a list of all the departments.  If you <span id = "bold">click</span> one of the departments, an @Search will be automatically done for you and the results
			will display.

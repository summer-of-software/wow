		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Window on the World, or WOW, is a tool which allows users to look up information on VTC faculty and staff.
		</p>
		<h3>How to use it</h3>
		<p>
			Some of the records are color coded.  
			People in Randolph will be displayed with a green background, Williston with a red, and other locations in white.
		</p>
			<h4>Search by Last Name</h4>
			<p>
				Click anywhere in the search box (the one with "Enter WOW search here...").  
				Type in the last name or part of the last name you want to search for.  
				Hit enter or click the search button and your results should appear.
			</p>
			<h4>Search by Last Name and First Name</h4>
			<p>
				Click anywhere in the search box.  
				Type in the last name or part of the last name, then add a space and type the first name or part of first name you want to find.  
				Hit enter or click the search button and your results should appear.
			</p>
			<h4>Search by First Name</h4>
			<p>
				Click anywhere in the search box.  
				First enter a space, then type the first name or part of first name that you want to find.  
				Hit enter or click the search button to get your results.
			</p>
			<h4>Other Searches</h4>
			<p>
				There are seven other searches available in WoW: phone, email, department, campus, role, fax and office.  
				These are accessible by using an '@', such as @dept or @office.  
				For example, searching for all offices in Green, you would enter "@office Green".
			</p>
			<h4>Printing search results</h4>
			<p>
				Hover the mouse pointer over the Print menu near the top of the screen.
				Move the pointer over the "Print Current Results" button so that it's highlighted and left-click.
				This will open a new window, so make sure that pop-up blockers allow it.

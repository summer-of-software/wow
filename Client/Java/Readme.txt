Window On the World (WOW) is a tool which allows users to look up information on VTC faculty and staff.

SEARCH BY LAST NAME
Click anywhere in the search box (the one with "Type WoW search here...").  Type in the last name or part of the last name you want to search for.  Hit enter or click the search button and your results should appear.

Note: Some of the records are color coded.  People in Randolph will be displayed with a green background, Williston with a red, and other locations in white.

SEARCH BY LAST NAME AND FIRST NAME
Click anywhere in the search box.  Type in the last name or part of the last name, then add a space and type the first name or part of first name you want to find.  Hit enter or click the search button and your results should appear.

SEARCH BY FIRST NAME
Click anywhere in the search box.  First enter a space, then type the first name or part of first name that you want to find.  Hit enter or click the search button to get your results.

OTHER SEARCHES
There are seven other searches available in WoW: phone, email, department, campus, role, fax and office.  These are accessible by using an '@', such as @dept or @office.  For example, searching for all offices in Green, you would enter "@office Green".

MORE INFO ON A RECORD
To find out more information than the table presents, double-click or right-click->"Open in new Info Window".  The first time this will open a new window displaying extended information about the person you selected.  If the window is already open, the selected person will be added to the window but the others will still be available through tabs on the left.  To switch records just click a tab.

USING THE EMAIL COLLECTION WINDOW (ECW)
The ECW is the way in which WOW makes temporary mailing lists.  To add an address to the ECW, right->click the record and select "Add to Email Collection". The first time this is selected, the ECW will pop up displaying the address you just added.  If the window is open, the email will be added and separated from other emails with a ";".  When you're ready to use your list, click copy and you should be able to paste into your normal email client.  Hitting clear in the ECW will clear the current list and prepare it for another list. 

PRINTING SEARCH RESULTS
Click the printer icon in the top menu.  Select one of the three print choices and click "Print."  Selecting "JUST current search results" will print a list of your most recent search.

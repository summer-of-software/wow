CI Environment
==============

# Win32 build: at the conclusion of every successful build a working executable should be packaged. Andy mentioned possibly using the NSIS installer for this.

# Unit test results should be displayed in CruiseControl.


CMS
===

# Wait on this until Jimbo creates vtank.vtc.edu; I'll push this.

# Setup the (Joomla) VTank CMS; use the default template for awhile. The main focus should be getting a CMS working that provides a place download the client, a place for users to discuss the game experience, and a place to learn about the VTank project. Let's not focus so much on aesthetics, rather, we'll focus on function.


WOW
===

# Chris: add the new records Jean-Marie spoke of

# Chris: update content for "Fast Help"
